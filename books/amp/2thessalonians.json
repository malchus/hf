(assembly) of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One):"},"2":{"verse_nr":2,"verse":"Grace (unmerited favor) be to you and [heart] peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One)."},"3":{"verse_nr":3,"verse":"We ought and indeed are obligated [as those in debt] to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, as is fitting, because your faith is growing exceedingly and the love of every one of you each toward the others is increasing and abounds."},"4":{"verse_nr":4,"verse":"And this is a cause of our mentioning you with pride among the churches (assemblies) of God for your steadfastness (your unflinching endurance and patience) and your firm faith in the midst of all the persecutions and crushing distresses and afflictions under which you are holding up."},"5":{"verse_nr":5,"verse":"This is positive proof of the just and right judgment of God to the end that you may be deemed deserving of His kingdom [a plain token of His fair verdict which designs that you should be made and counted worthy of the kingdom of God], for the sake of which you are also suffering."},"6":{"verse_nr":6,"verse":"[It is a fair decision] since it is a righteous thing with God to repay with distress and affliction those who distress and afflict you,"},"7":{"verse_nr":7,"verse":"And to [recompense] you who are so distressed and afflicted [by granting you] relief and rest along with us [your fellow sufferers] when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels in a flame of fire,"},"8":{"verse_nr":8,"verse":"To deal out retribution (chastisement and vengeance) upon those who do not know or perceive or become acquainted with God, and [upon those] who ignore and refuse to obey the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."},"9":{"verse_nr":9,"verse":"Such people will pay the penalty and suffer the punishment of everlasting ruin (destruction and perdition) and eternal exclusion and banishment from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power,"},"10":{"verse_nr":10,"verse":"When He comes to be glorified in His saints [on that day He will be made more glorious in His consecrated people], and [He will] be marveled at and admired [in His glory reflected] in all who have believed [who have adhered to, trusted in, and relied on Him], because our witnessing among you was confidently accepted and believed [and confirmed in your lives]."},"11":{"verse_nr":11,"verse":"With this in view we constantly pray for you, that our God may deem and count you worthy of [your] calling and [His] every gracious purpose of goodness, and with power may complete in [your] every particular work of faith (faith which is that leaning of the whole human personality on God in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness)."},"12":{"verse_nr":12,"verse":"Thus may the name of our Lord Jesus Christ be glorified and become more glorious through and in you, and may you [also be glorified] in Him according to the grace (favor and blessing) of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah, the Anointed One)."}}},"2":{"chapter_nr":2,"chapter":{"1":{"verse_nr":1,"verse":"BUT RELATIVE to the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) and our gathering together to [meet] Him, we beg you, brethren,"},"2":{"verse_nr":2,"verse":"Not to allow your minds to be quickly unsettled or disturbed or kept excited or alarmed, whether it be by some [pretended] revelation of [the] Spirit or by word or by letter [alleged to be] from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has [already] arrived and is here."},"3":{"verse_nr":3,"verse":"Let no one deceive or beguile you in any way, for that day will not come except the apostasy comes first [unless the predicted great falling away of those who have professed to be Christians has come], and the man of lawlessness (sin) is revealed, who is the son of doom (of perdition),"},"4":{"verse_nr":4,"verse":"Who opposes and exalts himself so proudly and insolently against and over all that is called God or that is worshiped, [even to his actually] taking his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming that he himself is God."},"5":{"verse_nr":5,"verse":"Do you not recollect that when I was still with you, I told you these things?"},"6":{"verse_nr":6,"verse":"And now you know what is restraining him [from being revealed at this time]; it is so that he may be manifested (revealed) in his own [appointed] time."},"7":{"verse_nr":7,"verse":"For the mystery of lawlessness (that hidden principle of rebellion against constituted authority) is already at work in the world, [but it is] restrained only until he who restrains is taken out of the way."},"8":{"verse_nr":8,"verse":"And then the lawless one (the antichrist) will be revealed and the Lord Jesus will slay him with the breath of His mouth and bring him to an end by His appearing at His coming."},"9":{"verse_nr":9,"verse":"The coming [of the lawless one, the antichrist] is through the activity and working of Satan and will be attended by great power and with all sorts of [pretended] miracles and signs and delusive marvels--[all of them] lying wonders--"},"10":{"verse_nr":10,"verse":"And by unlimited seduction to evil and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing (going to perdition) because they did not welcome the Truth but refused to love it that they might be saved."},"11":{"verse_nr":11,"verse":"Therefore God sends upon them a misleading influence, a working of error and a strong delusion to make them believe what is false,"},"12":{"verse_nr":12,"verse":"In order that all may be judged and condemned who did not believe in [who refused to adhere to, trust in, and rely on] the Truth, but [instead] took pleasure in unrighteousness."},"13":{"verse_nr":13,"verse":"But we, brethren beloved by the Lord, ought and are obligated [as those who are in debt] to give thanks always to God for you, because God chose you from the beginning as His firstfruits (first converts) for salvation through the sanctifying work of the [Holy] Spirit and [your] belief in (adherence to, trust in, and reliance on) the Truth."},"14":{"verse_nr":14,"verse":"[It was] to this end that He called you through our Gospel, so that you may obtain and share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah)."},"15":{"verse_nr":15,"verse":"So then, brethren, stand firm and hold fast to the traditions and instructions which you were taught by us, whether by our word of mouth or by letter."},"16":{"verse_nr":16,"verse":"Now may our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, Who loved us and gave us everlasting consolation and encouragement and well-founded hope through [His] grace (unmerited favor),"},"17":{"verse_nr":17,"verse":"Comfort and encourage your hearts and strengthen them [make them steadfast and keep them unswerving] in every good work and word."}}},"3":{"chapter_nr":3,"chapter":{"1":{"verse_nr":1,"verse":"FURTHERMORE, BRETHREN, do pray for us, that the Word of the Lord may speed on (spread rapidly and run its course) and be glorified (extolled) and triumph, even as [it has done] with you,"},"2":{"verse_nr":2,"verse":"And that we may be delivered from perverse (improper, unrighteous) and wicked (actively malicious) men, for not everybody has faith and is held by it."},"3":{"verse_nr":3,"verse":"Yet the Lord is faithful, and He will strengthen [you] and set you on a firm foundation and guard you from the evil [one]."},"4":{"verse_nr":4,"verse":"And we have confidence in the Lord concerning you, that you are doing and will continue to do the things which we suggest and with which we charge you."},"5":{"verse_nr":5,"verse":"May the Lord direct your hearts into [realizing and showing] the love of God and into the steadfastness and patience of Christ and in waiting for His return."},"6":{"verse_nr":6,"verse":"Now we charge you, brethren, in the name and on the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that you withdraw and keep away from every brother (fellow believer) who is slack in the performance of duty and is disorderly, living as a shirker and not walking in accord with the traditions and instructions that you have received from us."},"7":{"verse_nr":7,"verse":"For you yourselves know how it is necessary to imitate our example, for we were not disorderly or shirking of duty when we were with you [we were not idle]."},"8":{"verse_nr":8,"verse":"Nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and struggle we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden or impose on any of you [for our support]."},"9":{"verse_nr":9,"verse":"[It was] not because we do not have a right [to such support], but [we wished] to make ourselves an example for you to follow."},"10":{"verse_nr":10,"verse":"For while we were yet with you, we gave you this rule and charge: If anyone will not work, neither let him eat."},"11":{"verse_nr":11,"verse":"Indeed, we hear that some among you are disorderly [that they are passing their lives in idleness, neglectful of duty], being busy with other people's affairs instead of their own and doing no work."},"12":{"verse_nr":12,"verse":"Now we charge and exhort such persons [as ministers in Him exhorting those] in the Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) that they work in quietness and earn their own food and other necessities."},"13":{"verse_nr":13,"verse":"And as for you, brethren, do not become weary or lose heart in doing right [but continue in well-doing without weakening]."},"14":{"verse_nr":14,"verse":"But if anyone [in the church] refuses to obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person and do not associate with him, so that he may be ashamed."},"15":{"verse_nr":15,"verse":"Do not regard him as an enemy, but simply admonish and warn him as [being still] a brother."},"16":{"verse_nr":16,"verse":"Now may the Lord of peace Himself grant you His peace (the peace of His kingdom) at all times and in all ways [under all circumstances and conditions, whatever comes]. The Lord [be] with you all."},"17":{"verse_nr":17,"verse":"I, Paul, write you this final greeting with my own hand. This is the mark and sign [that it is not a forgery] in every letter of mine. It is the way I write [my handwriting and signature]."},"18":{"verse_nr":18,"verse":"The grace (spiritual blessing and favor) of our Lord Jesus Christ (the Messiah) be with you all. Amen (so be it)."}}}}}
